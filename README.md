# Fake_mail_detection
This is complete end to end fake mail detection project where flask is used to deploy this model

# Description
Fake Mail Detection is an innovative project that utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **tfidfvectorizer** with machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent emails and protect users from phishing and other email-based scams. Whether you're a security-conscious individual or a business looking to enhance your email security, our solution is designed to keep your inboxes safe.

# Features
**State-of-the-Art Detection:** Our model is trained on a vast dataset of real and fake emails to provide accurate detection.

**Flask Web Interface:** Deploy the ML model using flask technology and created api with the help of this.

**JSON API:** Integration with other applications is seamless, as the model offers JSON-formatted results through an API.
