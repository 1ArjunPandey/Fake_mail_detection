# Fake_mail_detection
This is complete end to end fake mail detection project where flask is used to deploy this model

# Description
Fake Mail Detection is an innovative project that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and tfidfvectorizer with machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent emails and protect users from phishing and other email-based scams. Whether you're a security-conscious individual or a business looking to enhance your email security, our solution is designed to keep your inboxes safe.

# Features
State-of-the-Art Detection: Our model is trained on a vast dataset of real and fake emails to provide accurate detection.
Flask Web Interface: Access the detection service through an intuitive web interface powered by Flask.
JSON API: Integration with other applications is seamless, as the model offers JSON-formatted results through an API.
# Demo

# Usage
Access the web interface by navigating to 'http://localhost:5000' in your browser.
Enter an email text in the provided input box.
Click "Detect" to receive an instant verdict on the authenticity of the email.
To integrate the API into your application, make POST requests to /api/detect with email content in JSON format.

# Contributing
We welcome contributions to enhance and expand the capabilities of this project. To contribute, please follow our contribution guidelines.

# Roadmap
Implement multi-language support for broader email text detection.
Enhance model accuracy through ongoing training and data enrichment.

# Acknowledgements
We would like to acknowledge the open-source NLP and machine learning libraries that made this project possible, including flask for deployment and scikit-learn for other works.
